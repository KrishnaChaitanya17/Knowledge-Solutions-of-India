Can you accurately predict insurance costs?


Create a ML models to predict the ‘Insurance cost’ with minimum MSE and RMSE and maximum R-Square score. Build the following models:
1.	Multiple linear regressor (MLR)
2.	Random Forest Regressor (RFR)
3.	MLR with PCA
4.	RFR with PCA
Plot the actual and predicted values for all the four models and plot the most significant features (output of PCA) against the output y_pred. Also write an inference on the models you prepared.
